# Habit-Tracker-V1

I started off with an expense tracker, however when i was trying to intergrate google sheets to store this data, my system crashed and i lost a big chunk of the code as well, so instead i have made a simple habit tracker where you can add habits, check them as done or not done using a checkbox, refresh the app to show all the tasks as not done, and the information of the user has been stored in a local storage using hive.
